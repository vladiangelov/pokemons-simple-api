# Pokemon Simple REST API

# How to install

1. Make sure your ruby version is 2.7.3 (using rbenv to manage ruby versions)

```
rbenv install 2.7.3
```

2. Install the latest rails gem

```
gem install rails
```

3. Install PostgreSQL

for Linux

```
sudo apt install -y postgresql postgresql-contrib libpq-dev build-essential
sudo -u postgres psql --command "CREATE ROLE `whoami` LOGIN createdb;"
```

for Mac

```
brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql
```

# How to start

## Local web server

_(Using the default Puma web server)_

1. Fork the repository from GitHub
2. Run `bundle install` to install all gems & dependencies
3. Run `rails db:create && rails db:migrate` to create and set the state of the Postgres DB instance
4. Run `rails server` to start the web server

## For testing

1. Run `rails db:test:prepare` to prepare the test database
2. Run `rails test` to run unit tests
3. Run `open coverage/index.html` (MacOS) or `xdg-open coverage/index.html` (Linux) to view unit test coverage stats

# How to update the pokemon list

Ideally this should be migrated to Sidekiq (or an alternative background job framework), but is currently run in console

1. Run `rails console`
2. Inside the console run `PokeApiImportService::ImportFullDataset.call(0.5)` - 0.5 is in seconds and is the number of seconds between requests to the remote API (in this case 2 requests per second)
3. This will fetch all pokemons and types from the Poke API
